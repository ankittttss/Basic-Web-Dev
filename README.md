A Basic Web Dev Project that fetches the data from an External Api called **Dummy Products**. And we have to Implement the Searching, Sorting and Pagination Functionality.
I have used Basic Logic of Fetch as Web Browser Api that help you to fetch data from the Api. Then I have used a Data Structure to store all of the data in a data structure. 
To manage the Sorting functionality I have kind of use a Comparator where I have sort the Data on the basis of Price and in **Ascending** and **Descending** Order.
